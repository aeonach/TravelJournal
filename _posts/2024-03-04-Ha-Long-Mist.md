Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO world heritage site in the north of Vietnam. If you have never heard the name (I hadn't), I'm sure that, like me you will have seen the images. Before we even left for this trip I searched and searched the internet, without a name it was hard to track down. Here it is in all it's glory! Many people make the trip here as a day trip from Hanoi. Aren't we glad we didn't choose that option!

It's two and a half hours drive here and the same back, with most operators leaving at 8am. I cannot imagine what anyone arriving around now would feel. We didn't book three days here because we were pessimistic about the weather, just so we could take it easy and take it all in. The weather is to clear up at around 4pm today. Not much luck for the day-trippers, but it looks like it will stay clear for at least another two days, so here is hoping.

Anyway, what a good day to go and track down the perfect boat trip.
