We're not numpties, we didn't just ignore the 'advisories', but we decided that changes happen rapidly and we'd watch for any advice along the way.

Both Google and Apple maps just don't understand this attitude.

We couldn't get either to give us an, anywhere reasonable, route to anywhere north of Flumeville. We were sure that this advisory was valid on the 22nd, but this was the 23rd. 

We spent most of that day ignoring the advice from our satnav:

'Turn around where possible'

Eventually we passed yesterday's impassible place and found ourselves on the C1 to fort Bragg. Even Google was happy to take us to Fort Bragg now, although two hours earlier they had formally advised against it. 

On Google's toute we'd have got to Fort Bragg somewhere around 6:30. Our route brought us there about three hours earlier. We were perfectly happy to stop then, even although we could probably have made it to Eureka. 

Weather looks better for the next few days, so let's see what the sat-nav has to say About the 1/101.
