After hanging around as a vague idea of something that we really 'should' do when I retired, the notion of visiting our friends and relatives around the world is now becoming very real.

When I did finally retire at the end of March, we had a head full of ideas about what we wanted to do around Scotland. All that work getting the van just right would now pay off. In January we booked a trip to St Kilda and that gave us a good excuse to re-visit Lewis. The last time we were there, was just after the first Covid lockdown. Although we had a great time, there were a few things we wished we could have visited. We also now had Jenny and Mike to visit. I must say, however, that we hadn't held out much hope that the visit to St. Kilda would come off at that time of year, April in Scotland can still throw a bunch of weather at you. In the end the weather was better than many a mid-summer's day and so we had a great time on St. Kilda. 

Soon after that something else came back to mind: hadn't we been invited to Gina's wedding? Gina lives in New Zealand. It might sound a long way for a wedding, but then that vague idea of an 'around the world ticket' started to grow arms and legs. Yes, that was it. Now when was that wedding again?

For the wedding we would have to be in New Zealand sometime around the middle of May. With our date to leave set as the 13th of December, we had a lot of planning to do. This would probably be our last chance at such a trip, so we wanted to see as much as we could, but not just running around ticking off all the must see sights. We wanted to stop long enough to get a real feel for the countries we were going to visit. Nonetheless, with that deadline in May there was always going to be a danger of trying to cram too much in. That's exactly what we did.


We made a list of 'must sees' which included Egypt, Jordan, India, China and Japan. First off we planned 4-5 weeks in Egypt and a week in Jordan. Then it was 4 weeks in India and a minimum of 3 weeks in each of China and Japan. It wasn't until we sat down and started booking our flights that we realised this was going to be a bit of rush. Our flight arriving in Bangkok would leave us with four weeks to get to Jogjakarta and our flight to Beijing via Singapore. Well, for South East Asia  we would just have to pick and choose and maybe even just miss out on a lot.

We got the bones of our flight arrangements all booked up. Glasgow to Cairo via London, with almost five weeks in Egypt before flying to Amman for a further week. From Amman it was a flight to New Delhi and almost five weeks in India. After that Delhi to Bangkok and making our own way to Jogjakarta with a Flight to Singapore and a two night stopover. We really did need to see Raffles and drink at least one Singapore sling! :-) Then a flight to Beijing and three weeks with our own travel arrangements to get to Hong Kong for the flight to Tokyo. Three weeks in Japan, surely not enough, but sacrifices and compromises it had to be. We also booked flights to Australia, New Zealand, and Chile. From Chile we would have about 5 months to make our way to Canada and our flights back home.

We put the Antipodes and the Americas to the back of our minds to concentrate on that first six months of our trip taking us eventually to Australia. Especially China since in order to get a visa we'd have to have proof of our flights in and out and the booked accommodation for every night of our stay there. Anyway, that's the stuff of another post.
