After hanging around as a vague idea of something that we really 'should' do when I retired, the notion of visiting our friends and relatives around the world is now becoming very real.

When it finally happened  at the end of March, we had a head full of ideas about what we wanted to do around Scotland. All that work getting the van just right would now pay off.

In January we booked a trip to St Kilda which also gave us a good excuse to re-visit Lewis. The last time we were there was just after the first Covid lockdown and although we had a great time, there were a few things we just couldn't visit. Then too, we also now had Jenny and Mike to visit. I must say, however, that we hadn't held out much hope for the visit to St. Kilda. April in Scotland can still throw a bunch of weather at you, but how wrong we were. In the end the weather was better than many a mid-summer's day. St. Kilda - well, that's a post all of it's own. Soon after St Kilda something else came back to mind: hadn't we been invited to Gina's wedding? 

Gina lives in New Zealand. It might sound a long way for a wedding, but then that vague idea of visiting friends and family, turned into an idea of getting an 'around the world' ticket. Yes, that was it. Now when was that wedding again?

For the wedding we would have to be in New Zealand sometime around the middle of May. We decided upon the 13th of December as our start date, so we had a lot of planning to do. Since his might be our last chance at such a big trip, we wanted to see as much as we could, but we didn't want to just run around ticking off all the must see sights. We wanted to stop long enough to get a real feel for the countries we were going to visit. Nonetheless, with that deadline in May there was always going to be a danger of trying to cram too much in and that's exactly what we ended up doing.


We made a list of what we thought were our 'must see' places. Initially that included Egypt, Jordan, India, China and Japan. First off we planned 4-5 weeks in Egypt and a week in Jordan. Then it was 4 weeks in India and a minimum of 3 weeks in each of China and Japan. It wasn't until we sat down and started booking our flights that we realised this was going to be a bit of rush. Our flight arriving in Bangkok would leave us with four weeks to get to Jogjakarta and our flight to Beijing via Singapore. Well, for South East Asia  we would just have to pick and choose and maybe even just miss out on a lot.

We got the bones of our flight arrangements all booked up. Glasgow to Cairo via London, with almost five weeks in Egypt before flying to Amman for a further week. From Amman it was a flight to New Delhi and almost five weeks in India. After that Delhi to Bangkok and making our own way to Jogjakarta with a Flight to Singapore and a two night stopover. We really did need to see Raffles and drink at least one Singapore sling! :-) Then a flight to Beijing and three weeks with our own travel arrangements to get to Hong Kong for the flight to Tokyo. Three weeks in Japan, surely not enough, but sacrifices and compromises it had to be. We also booked flights to Australia, New Zealand, and Chile. From Chile we would have about 5 months to make our way to Canada and our flights back home.

We put the Antipodes and the Americas to the back of our minds to concentrate on that first six months of our trip taking us eventually to Australia. We didn't really want to have everything booked up like a package holiday, but then there was China. In order to even get a visa permitting us visit China, we'd need to have evidence of our flights in and out of the country and booked accommodation for every night of our stay there. 

Anyway, that's the stuff of another post.
