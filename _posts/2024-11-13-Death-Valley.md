We ended up back in Flagstaff. How strange, now we could visit The Painted Desert and The Petrified Forest and end up in a town called Holbrook. 

Holbrook? I know neither had we and we have nothing special to report. 

Now, we are headed for Phoenix, for reasons undisclosed. Our real destination: the Mojave Desert and Death Valley. But wait, our friend Marlene suggested that, since we we were driving to Phoenix, we should go via Sonoma. 

Of course we could manage another detour. We did and it was spectacular.

Now! We do need to get back on track.
