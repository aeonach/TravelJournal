It didn't really creep up on us, it landed with a splat on Sunday! 

Only Monday to sort out whatever we had left to do. I must admit that Vanessa was much better prepared than me, she even had her bags packed by about Friday. Anyway, we had decided by then to give up on all the booking and stuff for the trip. India has a pretty solid itinerary in place.

There were a few places where the train journey was horribly wrong, with a lot of backtracking. Jaisalmer to Barmer, for instance. The best bet for that was going to be hiring a driver we decided. Still better than resorting to flying, although some flights were inevitable for the goals we had set.

Then there was the problems with Booking.com. I have to admit that most of those bookings (fingers crossed) seem to be okay, but there were a few dodgy ones. In spite of the fact that booking said pay at the property, some came back and insisted we pay immediately. 'Due to the great demand for the time we had booked, only by paying now could we guarantee to get any accommodation.' It felt a bit off, so we had a look again at those places. Yes all those 10/10 reviews. There were clear signs there were plenty of fakes. In the end we decided to see what we can find when we get there.

We woke up on Wednesday morning after our night out in Glasgow and it was gloriously sunny after four days of solid rain. A bit of a forlorn feeling about leaving, but we *will* be back.
