So how do you come down to earth after a year of exploring this precious globe of ours?

"What was your favourite place?… What was the one place that made you feel uncomfortable?… Which place surprised you the most?"

I don’t know yet. Not until it floats down from somewhere in my subconscious and gently becomes real…


We wandered in wonder around ancient palaces and temples…imagined the life of the bare breasted dancing girls, the soldiers, slaves and the splendor of the elelphants carrying the conquerors of those many wars. 

Said a silent prayer to those young wives and concubines comitted to die on their husband’s funeral pyre.

Marvelled at the intricate marble inlays of the Taj Mahal and the choreography of New Dehli traffic!

Scooped up perfect dhal with the best nan ever and washed it all down with a cold 	Kingfisher beer. 

Looked in awe at the sleeping Buddah head cradled between the growing roots of the Bodhi tree.

Counted up the 29 Buddah caves in Ajanta and found Ganesh in the caves at Ellora.

Went swimming with elephants and glided down the Mekong along with over a hundred eager tourists hungerly watching them eat as we forgot there was no food on the boat, but the secenery more than made up for it.

Devoured Pad Thai in the street markets of Changmai and mouthwatering crunchy spring rolls in Vientiane.

Tried to decifer the paddy fields of Sa Pa through the mist that never lifted and the drizzle that just stayed.

Catching the iconic sunrise over Ankor Wat, but went round the side for a far better shot. The palaces of Ankor Thom being swallowed by the tentacled roots of ancient trees just left us in awe. 

Chicken satay in Singapore and the bowl of chicken noodles with the floating claws/hands that cried out to be saved!

In search of brushes in the back streets of Beijing, thankful for the translate app that let us order Peking Duck and have a laugh with the old boys in a bar afterwards.

The mighty Great Wall and fighting the crowds just for a glimpse of the Terracotta warriors. 

The serenity of the houses of the Samurai and the elegance of the couples dressed in their kimonos and the best deep fried gyozas and noodles in broth.

When do I stop?  There’s  New Zealand, Kakadu and Uluru, Rapa Nui, Machu Picchu
and the Galapagos…USA and Canada!

And of course, the old friends we caught up with after too many years and the new friends we made.

We really did do it!!
