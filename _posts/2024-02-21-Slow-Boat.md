Here we are, although what I thought was to be our big adventure looks like it might just turn out to be another...

Let's see.

Sitting here in the morning sun by the Mekong, it can't go that wrong. Here in the ChanChao Cafe having breakfasted on a  delicious omlette and baguette. As usual we have arrived early, but still the time flies and I'm having to rush this post off.

The first leg of our journey is from Houeixai to Pakbeng, as I write this Vanessa, as is her wont, is on Booking trying to secure us a bed for tonight. Tomorrow's leg is from Pakbeng to Luang Prabang, where we intend to stay a few nights before catching the train to Vientiane.

Here's hoping today is what we wished for.
