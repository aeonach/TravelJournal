Just another day. Now I'm also an Australian reject.

We have seriously thought of just re-routing, but we do have friends in Australia we would really like to see - no matter how unfriendly their Government happens to be!

Vanessa is, of course, perfectly welcome in Australia. They just don't like the company she keeps. 

We are trying to sort that out: I've sent them lots of stuff to try to convince them that I'm not the bad boy they think I am (maybe used to be).

I promise that I have enough money to keep myself and that I won't work or, god forbid, 'sign-on'! I won't go into hospital, or in any other way steal all those valuable resources that Australian people need. 

That was all easy - if I needed any of those things, I have them all at home.

Anyway, we're just waiting to see if they believe me. I did tell a few 'porkies' the last time I was there!
