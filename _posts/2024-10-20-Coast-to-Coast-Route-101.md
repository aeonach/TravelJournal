We've quickly knocked together a route that takes us across America, Coast to Coast and then north to Seattle hugging the pacific wherever we can. The route is a little shy of four thousand miles, although with the detours we intend to make it will be a good bit over that. We decided to cancel New York and use the extra time and money for this new adventure.

We have our tried and tested formula from Australia: three hundred miles a day. That means we need not more than fourteen days, but even I would find that a bit of a hell trip! However, just like Australia we have all those extra days to explore - what exploring we have to do!

I've mentioned them before, but no apologies for doing so again!

- **The Petrified Forest National Park**, with it's painted desert.
- **The Grand Canyon National Park**, what is there to say - one of the seven wonders.
- **The Mojave National Preserve** and *possibly* **Death Valley National Park**.
- **Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks**, home to the biggest trees in the world.
- **Redwood National an State Parks**, home to the world's tallest trees.
- **Yosemite** Please give us the eye of Ansel Adams and grace us with the light he found.

We may or may not make all of those detours, since we will save five days for the end where we hope to drive the Pacific Coast Highway (Route 101) from San Francisco to Seattle.

Funny, only a week ago it felt as though our trip had just fizzled out, yet here we are off on another adventure.
