As I write this, it was yesterday that we took our boat trip in Halong Bay. It is a very special place and deserving of its UNESCO badge, but...

We were lucky. In the morning it was still very misty, but unlike the day we arrived, there were clear signs that the sun was trying to break through, it did. Although the mist and haze never did fully clear. The haze and the sheer immensity of the place made it difficult to capture with the lens, especially from the level of the sea. At times like this you can just look, and wonder.

There is, of course, another problem with Ha Long Bay. there are too many people, but those too many people are us, all of us.

Still, I am glad that we came to this amazing natural wonder and glad that we had the luck of the one good day this week. Today, again, the sun never broke through the clouds and the thick mist barely lifted. The few photos that we were lucky enough to get will never do this place justice, but we'll post them soon.

Today, we had a day devoted almost solely to organising our last few days in South East Asia. We've had a few rest days along the way - our days in Goa, for instance, and this is, kind of, a rest day too, but with a lot of work to do.

When we left India and all its pre-planned travel, we'd thought about how great it would be finally just 'see where we go next', even if that was only only for eight weeks.

We strolled our way through Thailand and Laos, but we didn't see much. Certainly not nearly enough. Then again, as early as India we'd concluded that you just can't see everything and I only mean everything on your route, that tiny part of the country you visit. We've learned that when you stray even a little from your chosen path, there is a whole world that you miss.

Now we have less than four weeks left in South East Asia. We have a rough idea of the places that we 'must' vist, but as we sit and try to break this next month into the parcels of days that we need for each of those places, we realise that our 'must list breaks apart and becomes a 'really must' list, without any of the 'musts' surrendering.
