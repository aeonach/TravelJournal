Last night in Australia.

I wanted to sit and ponder what it would be that we missed about this country and a lot it will be, but there is something else on my mind that crowds all of that out. It's not passing the halfway mark and heading home, although that does always cross your mind. No, it's again moving into unfamiliar territory - the unknown. 

My only experience of South America is crossing the border into Tijuana on a trip to LA 30 years ago. 

It's exciting. 

Here in Australia the only challenges we've had to deal with for the last 3 months have been the challenges we set ourselves. Now the challenges will be those that we find along the way.

Oh yes! We have a new destination on the agenda - we are hoping to fly to Costa Rica to see our friends Guiseppe and Paula.
