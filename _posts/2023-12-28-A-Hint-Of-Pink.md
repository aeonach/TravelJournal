Research and research, chasing through Lonley Planet, Rough Guide, 
Googling Jiapur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmair, yes I've got it....No. After two weeks
of amazement, surprises, contradictions are still constantly knocking 
me sideways. 

Through the tangled throng of tuk tuks at Jiapur station, welcome to the Pink City.  
Being a while back now (1876) since the pink was painted for a royal visit, a faded tone is now what's left over of the city of pink -  echoing a hint of a bygone era.

A flurry of oranges, reds and chatter as the women rush by to the pond of healing Ganges water at the Galtaji (or monkey) Temple. Faded frescos of dancers and elephant hunts, cover the inside of the ruined temples while the monkeys drape themselves over every arch and column. 

Leaving Galtaji, with a smudge of orange on our foreheads and holy string around our wrists it felt we had definitely arrived in India.
