Santa Fe eventually got more than ten inches of snow, so we were pretty happy we'd made the decision to brave it. It only took us a couple of hours, in spite of the snow, to reach Albuquerque where we had pessimistically decided would be our destination that day.

Even although it was still early we searched 'Booking.com' trying to find somewhere to stay. In our price range everything either sounded dodgy, or just plain shit. Albuquerque wasn't part of our itinerary anyway, just a place we'd pass through. Maybe spend the night if we had to, but only on our way to our next big destination: The Grand Canyon. 

Flagstaff! 

It was still morning and only 325 miles away. We could base ourselves there for The Grand Canyon. 

That was it, we junked Albuquerque and headed for Flagstaff. It worked out fine and we even arrived early enough in the evening to be able to congratulate ourselves in having made the right choice

We do have to mention that we did pass the signs for the 'Painted Desert' and 'The Petrified Forest'. 

Hadn't those been on our list?

Och well - ye cannae do everything.
