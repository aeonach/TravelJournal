The call to prayer seems to follow our trail, this time caught on the warm dessert breeze. The cows, dogs, tuk-tuks are here, but in a more gentle way and there are camels. Up on the hill as if rising out of the sand sits Jaisalmer fort. Inside it’s a living breathing mass. Sandstone elephants guard the corners of the temples. Washing hangs along walls and balconies allowing brief glimpses of otherwise hidden intricate friezes. Along every alley beautiful hand sewn patchwork drape over doorways ‘ancient fabrics from the dessert’ temptation at every turn.

Young fliers expertly keep their kites soaring ever higher into the clear blue sky. Watching them I realise how calm I’ve become regardless of the screeching traffic and the ‘selfie?’ ‘selfie?’.
It’s India with all its colours, contrasts and vibrance and its absolutely remarkable.

Chittagarth. A hard working town with a Unesco World Heritage Site Fort, this one possibly the largest in India. Ruined temples and palaces rise up amongst the trees and shrubs and one selfie I couldn’t refuse!  A basic rooftop cafe welcomes at last with beer and delicious chole chana and chapatti. It was the only one we found and perfect.

With an echo of Auld Lang Syne welcome 2024.
