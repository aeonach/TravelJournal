We had decided that Mumbai would be time for a rest and to take stock.

It felt like we had been constantly chasing our own tails, getting on a train or a bus every 2-3 days and trying to fill those days with as much as possible of the wonderful sights and sounds of India. We probably didn't do Mumbai itself the justice it deserved, but we did need the rest and our suite at Four Points in Navi Mumbai, was just the place for that. Swimming in the rooftop pool in the sunshine above the smog of central Mumbai was a real treat.

All of the staff at the hotel made us feel like we were special guests and we'd like to thank them all for that.

It's goodbye to Mumbai for us now and of to Aurangabad and back on the tourist route. Although I will get back to Mumbai soon and our eventful arrival at Mumbai Central Station.
