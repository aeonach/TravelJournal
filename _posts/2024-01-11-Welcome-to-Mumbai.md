We knew we would be arriving late and we knew that, just like Delhi, this is a big city. When we arrived in Delhi we were just arriving in India and we decided to take it easy on ourselves. We had a pre-booked taxi from the airport. Mumbai? Train arriving at 9:45 pm, if it’s on time. Could be a good idea to have transport waiting. No, no, no. It’s a big city there’ll be hundreds of taxis queued outside the station and they are all metered. What’s-more, I’ve downloaded the “BLACK YELLOW TAXI (CNG) TARIFF CARD (w.e.f. 01/10/2022).” I know, I know, it doesn’t sound very ‘in date’, but it is the ‘authentic tariff card issued by Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Department’ and the link is tagged as ‘new’. Anyway old or new it will be our guide. It even tells you the excess tariff for luggage, the ‘Waiting charges as per clause no. 4.18.1 of Khatua Committee report.’ It doesn’t mention Toll Charges, but there’s an Uber blog for that.

What can possibly go wrong…
