Heading to Darwin, we’d been camping in the rest areas that are ocaisionally dotted along the Stuart highway, some with a toilet (a hole in the ground in a shed), some without. It was time for a a campsite, shower and clean clothes. Cooinda in Kakadu National Park was close by and although it was abit of a holiday ‘leisure’ park the showers worked and so did the washing machines.

A brief note about the alchol restrictions in Nothern Territories. Bottle shops open from 4pm-8pm.
You need id and you are restricted to one slab of beer (24 cans) or 2 bottles of wine or 1 bottle of wine and one bottle of spirits (combinations can vary depending on which town you find yourself in). Or, if staying in a campsite you get given a ticket per person which enables you to buy whatever alchol you want as long as you sit at the bar/restaurant and don’t take it away.
This we decided to do.

On the menu was grilled Barramundi with chips and salad. We decided to share one.
Absolutly beautiful. Not too fishy just succulent silky flakes of delicate white fish that melt in the mouth. 

Having googled ‘Barramundi’ it turns out it’s one of the most healthy fish, to quote:
‘Low in fat and high in omega-3 fatty acids’. Even the ancient Aboriginals, in their wisdom, must have known this, as their exquisite rock art includes many wonderful images of the Barramundi with its caracteristic up-turned mouth.

And so having discovered this wonderful fish we had it:

Grilled at Jabiru
Battered at Lizard Creek
In a pie at Doon Doon road house
And fried it ourselves at Cooinda campsite

We’re pausing for now, but will return later to our new healthy and delicious fishy gastronomic discovery, which also goes nicely with a chilled Pinot Noir!
