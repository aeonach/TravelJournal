From the womb-like existence of the flight to "That not visa" from Immigration. Searching frantically through emails 
I point to "Application Status Granted".

Welcome to India.

Outside bewildering, noisy, smoggy, extraordinary. Taxis and tuk-tuks with their constant shrill of horns intricately 
weave between children, dogs, cows, cars, buses, people and us as we attempt to exit the taxi and enter the hotel.

A guide, a taxi and a tour of Delhi. Shoeless we are guided through a Sikh temple. Beautiful, serene and humbling. 
Volunteers podding peas and preparing chapatis, and serving all who walk in. Old men with towering turbans of dark 
blue, women with orange and yellow head coverings contrast with the coarse blue and pink of the plastic trays being 
filled with the peas and chapattis.

Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi and the spice filled air of the Spice Market. Squeezing through alleyways and up 
crowded stairs everywhere sacks overflowing with turmeric, chillies, lentils, beans of every variety, a photographers 
delight!

The first of many Forts - the Red Fort and hard to get a sense of the atmosphere with so many others doing the same as 
us. Our early introduction to the exquisite inlaid details on marble but constantly hassled when we just wanted to look.
A repeat at the Taj Mahal definitely the wrong day or maybe its always like this. Grabbed a few photos and left.

Peace and calm amongst the ruins of Old Delhi Fort. Time to take it all in, at last.
