Our trip by slowboat down the Mekong, for all our scepticism at the start, turned out to be a highlight of our time in Laos. Lots of Laon life is along the Mekong and travelling at the pace of the river is the best way to see it.

The next step on our journey is Hanoi and Vietnam where we hope to travel the length of the country by train ending up in Ho Chi Minh (Saigon), with enough time left to visit Cambodia and Ankor Wat before our flight to China on the 3rd of April.

We have 4 days in Sapa an Old French hillstation about five or six hours from Hanoi. Hoping to sort out some of our photos when we are there.
