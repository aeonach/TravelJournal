We had decided that The Grand Canyon needed *at least* two days and we thought we could base ourselves in Flagstaff. 

'It's only an hour and a half' 

wW said to purselves. That's self delusion: it's three hours - you also have to come back ya daftie!

Flagstag was a great place to start out from and we had an amazing first day walking and 'shuttling' our way along the western part of the South Rim. It's hard to describe and I'm pretty sure there isn't an image of it that can convey the granduer. 

Still we took our photos and we tried. We will post our underwhelming results, eventually.

The one clear memory I had from my previous visit in 1991 was of taking an old pony or mule trail that wound its way down the sheer face of the South Rim to the base of the canyon. I now know it was the 'Bright Angel Trail. The clearest memory I have is of passing some ancient pictographs that were evem close enough to touch, so we set off down the trail, with my vague memory that the pictographs we sought were near the head of the trail. 

With each turn and switchback we and no pictographs we said to ourselves:

'The next one.'

Eventually we turned back.

We were still overwhelmed by everything we had seen, so anything we missed didn't really matter. 

Still, it wasn't finished. As we had arranged to stay much closer to the park than Flagstaff, we could stay on until after sunset and enjoyed a brilliant astronomy session laid on by the park. It was great.

Back 'home', the place we had arranged wasn't the most salubrious, but it was more than adequate and perfect for our last day at The Grand Canyon - we'd planned thr 'Scenic Drive' along the eastern part of the South Rim.
