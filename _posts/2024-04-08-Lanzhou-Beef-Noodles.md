>Beef noodles are light, refreshing, affordable and cheap. And it makes both southerners, northerners and foreign friends feel wonderful and incredible! It is not too much for us to regard it as a modelling performance of pasta art. Lanzhou Xiaotang beef noodles not only has the characteristics of rotten and soft beef, white radish, red and bright spicy oil, green coriander, soft noodles, smooth and refreshing, soup, harmonious flavours, fragrant and appetising, etc., but also has many kinds of noodles, including "big wide" with two fingers wide and one finger wide "two wide" and "leek leaves shaped like grass leaves. ", "a nest of silk" as thin as silk thread, "buckwheat edges" in the shape of three edges, etc., as well as "two fine", "three", "fine", "capillary" and so on., tourists can choose according to their hobbies. A bowl of noodles is just a bowl of noodles, which are not only smooth and refreshing, delicious, but also chic in appearance. Local people describe it as one clear, two white, three green, four red and five yellow, that is, although the beef soup is prepared with more than a dozen seasonings, it disappears like white water. Several pieces of white radish mixed with red and green appear pure white. The soup is floating with fresh green garlic sprouts, the chilli oil is red, and the noodles are bright and yellow. Therefore, the reputation of Lanzhou beef noodles continues to this day.

This morning the 8th of April we were treated to a bowl of freshly made Lanzhou Beef Noodles for breakfast. It was wonderful to watch the chef make your portion of noodles on the spot, just throw them into boiling water for a few minutes and then his assistant scoop them into a bowl to be filled with broth, a spoonful of beef pieces and leave us to add the spices and other delicacies. It'll be hard going back to cornflakes!
