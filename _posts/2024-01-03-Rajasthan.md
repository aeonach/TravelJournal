I’ve already tried to describe the feeling of arriving into Delhi and India. We had no difficulty leaving Delhi, but the effect that Delhi had upon us was probably harder to escape than the city itself.  As we gradually moved east from Jaipur to Jodhpur and then Jaisalmer, we also felt many other gradual changes some to do with us and some with those places.

Our train arrived in Jaipur late at night; I’m never sure if that is a good or bad thing. However, we were immediately approached with the offer of a Tuk-Tuk at an uncommonly fair price and were at our hotel fairly quickly. It was a haveli, ‘heritage’ of course, with rooms on three floors arranged on balconies around the now covered central courtyard. As we approached check-in another guest, perhaps collecting his key welcomed us to ‘a little piece of paradise in the concrete jungle’. We were too tired to think much on it, but at least it sounded like the hotel hadn’t been a bad choice. Next day it was hard to know if we’d even escaped the smog of Delhi, we certainly still hadn’t escaped the crowds. 

Like Delhi, Jaipur is plagued by helpful people who ask you were you are going, but better know where you should be going; the Tuk-Tuk drivers every bit as persistent and seemed even more plentiful. There was also the new hazard of the Tuk-Tuk driver and friend. Most drivers just ply the roads or hang out at particular spots looking for fares. They usually only approach you in their Tuk-Tuk.  At least when a Tuk-Tuk approaches you on behalf of it’s driver you fairly well know what you’ve got, even if you didn’t particularly want it. It’s not that Tuk-Tuk drivers never leave their vehicles, around the stations many do. However this new intermediary isn’t really there to offer you the transport you need, rather with the lure of the well known tourist attractions he knows most want to see, he sees it as his duty to introduce you to the other experiences you aren’t yet aware you need. In this duo the Tuk-Tuk driver is now a faceless operator bent to the needs of both you and your new self-appointed guide. We have learned to spot and studiously avoid this arrangement, but these guys are smooth and it’s easy to get caught on this merry-go-round.

The places you really need to see are the various Emporia selling anything from brass monkeys to magic carpets. As always: “No need to buy - just look.” No matter how hard-nosed you think you are, you give in at least once. It’s then you find that right enough there is no obligation to buy, but your still going to find that you have let a lot of people down including your Tuk-Tuk operator. Stick with just letting him down in future and leave the carpet sellers to deal with real buyers.

Onetime we were even sitting with a 42 carat emerald in one hand and a slightly smaller topaz in the other. This guy isn’t even a jewellery seller, at pains to let you know that’s now handled by his family. We’d been told about this Indian guru guy, he was in the Marigold Hotel film, you vaguely remember the character, but can’t quite remember who it was that played him. Anyway, this guy really does know the problems you’ve had in your life, bang-on or pretty close every time, and since his move into ‘crystal therapy’ he now knows that these are the stones that will heal your wounds and the lesions you’ve inflicted on that significant other. For a ‘healer’, he really has managed to make you feel uneasy, just hopefully not uneasy enough to buy those gems. 

Don’t ask how we got there, but don’t worry we left him with the glass. A quick google: That was not Dev Patel we’d just been with. As for all the stuff he knew about your past: I’m sure you wouldn’t need to read too many self-help or popular psychology books to come up with at least four emotional hang-ups with a strike rate of at least ninety-five percent. And the real trick was the twist with the one you where you think: “Nope can’t remember that.” Really! You don’t remember that. Maybe that’s what’s caused the deepest scars and maybe you need to go away and find out about that so that the healing can begin. One stone each for you and the victim.

I’m not sure if it was this hassle that precipitated our new attitude to travel, but it did happen around this time. We don’t have to see everything. Instead of rushing around taking in the tourist sites, it would be good to just sit back and enjoy the place. As we moved to new places, like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and finally, in Rajasthan, Udaipur, each seemed a lot more laid back. You still had a constant stream of people wanting to know ‘what is your name’, ‘where are you leeving’, ‘can I take one selfie’. However, now it seemed mostly an innocent curiosity. 

We were of course changing, but it would be a great injustice not to see that the people we met, especially in Jaisalmer and Udaipur, were very different because these cities are very different. I’m not sure if I could put those differences into words. Perhaps I should do nothing more than try to describe them.
