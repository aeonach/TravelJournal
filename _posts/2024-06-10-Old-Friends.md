We’re in a sort of familiar land and a change of pace.

It’s June and leaves are falling, winter is approaching, well, not like a Scottish winter more like a Scottish summer! 

Houses face north for the sun and the stars are upside down. Although I’m yet to check, they say even the water in the sink runs away in the opposite direction.

Sharing time with dear old friends (old in time not age), swapping memories and gossip. Catching up with time that seems to have slipped by too quickly.

Picking up our hired campervan we went to explore New Zealand’s South Island. A magical, mysterious land. Tropical rainforests, snow dusted mountains, lakes so still that they mirror the land that sits beside them, and water. So much water.  It twists and turns its way through crevices and cracks through the jungle clad mountain side or it pounds its way in stupendous waterfalls clear and turquoise from the glaciers high up, charging its way down to the sea.

Though the days were sunny the nights, velvet black and studded with those upside down stars, were freezing and going to bed in what should have been cosy was very much a brave and fully clad experience, the reward though was waking to a dawn of scarlet sunrises. 

The Pinot Noir from central Otago, the local region, was smooth warm and rich which kept the cold at bay and the Scotch sirloin (our ribeye) fried in salt crystal butter made a very comforting tea.

So having reached the southernmost point on our journey at the southernmost tip of New Zealand, it’s now up the other side.
