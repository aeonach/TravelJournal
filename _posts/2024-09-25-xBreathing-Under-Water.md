The water is crystal clear turquoise but there's a chill in the wind and the sky is more grey than blue. Shall I? shan't I ? ...mask and snorkle at the ready in I go, and it's wonderful, pure Jaques Cousteau. 
I'm gliding through a shoal of translucent little fish with yellow smudges on their backs and black stripes that look as if they're drawn on with a crayon. It's stunning and I don't even have to come up for air, I'm breathing under water in this magnificent aquariam. 

A dark shadow appears, it's a shark, it's a...it's a turtle gently swaying with the current nibbling the algae on the rocks. It's a dream world in which I'm the priveledged observer floating in a watery sky. 

Orange and turquoise stripes, a whole team of them rush by me as a shy sweet young thing deep midnight blue, her yellow tipped fins fluttering as she looks at me with powting lips and big dewy eyes under yellow eyebrows. We stare in awe of each other and then she scurries off and I glide on. 

The current pulls me back and forth, I hold on to rocks to steady myself while catching glimpses of silver streaks as they dart in and out of the rock crevices. Oh no!...I thought I was gliding along but not like this enormous sealion and it's coming right at me! I turn as fast as I can just missing him. I watch as he effortlessly slips in between the rocks thankfully being totally oblivious to me.

Fighting the current I haul myself over the rocks one at a time until slowly I put my feet down on sand and head to the shore.

Dry off and back in again.
