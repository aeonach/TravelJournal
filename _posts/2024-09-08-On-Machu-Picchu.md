I am not sure what to say about Machu Picchu, that 'Lost City of the Incas'. It certainly was an incredible place in an equally incredible location, perched atop a ridge with vertiginous sides. Just clinging there, defying gravity. 

I fear we did not see the best of it, but that was our fault. We did not prepare enough in advance and did not give it the time it deserved. However, I refuse to take all the blame.

The way the routes are set up and the need to follow a guide everywhere, does make you feel a little corralled. However, we either mistakenly hired a private guide, or we were mistakenly assigned a private guide. Apart from all the talk he was great. We had taken what we later found out to be the shortest route, but he linked us into another route, so we essentially did the route instead of the one we'd booked.

It was a magnificent place to see. A poignant reminder of all the advanced civilisations that Europeans laid to waste.
