After hanging around as a vague idea of something that we really 'should' do when I retired, it's now becoming very real.

When I did finally retire at the end of March, we had a head full of ideas about what we to do around Scotland. All that work getting the van just right would now pay off. In January we booked a trip to St Kilda and that gave uas a good excuse to re-visit Lewis. The last time we were there, was just after the first Covid lockdown. Although we had a great time there were a few things we wished we could have visited. We also now had Jenny and Mike to visit. We hadn't held out a lot of hope that the visit to St. Kilda would come of at that time of year, April in Scotland can still throw a bunch of weather at you. In the end the weather was better than many a mid-summer day and we had a good time on St. Kilda. 

Soon after that something else came back to mind: hadn't we been invited to Gina's wedding? Gina lives in New Zealand. It might be long way for a wedding, but then that vague idea of an 'around the world ticket' started to grow arms and legs. Yes, that was it. Now when was the wedding again?

We had to be in New Zealand sometime around the middle of May. With our date to leave set as the 13th of December, we had a lot of planning to do. This will probably be our last chance at such a trip, so we wanted to see as much as we could, but not just running around ticking off all the must see sights, we wanted to stop long enough to get a real feel for the countries we were going to visit. Nonetheless, with that deadline in May there was always going to be a danger of trying to cram too much in. that's exactly what we did.

We had a list of must go to's which included Egypt, Jordan, India, China and Japan. Oops! There is also the whole of South East Asia in between too. First off we planned 4-5 weeks in Egypt and a week in Jordan. Then it was 4 weeks in India and a minimum of 3 weeks in each of China and Japan. It wasn't until we sat down and started booking our flights that we realised this was all going to be a bit of rush. We booked a flight arriving in Bangkok with four weeks to get to Jogjakarta and our flight to Beijing via Singapore. Well, we would just have to pick and choose and maybe even just miss out on a lot.

We got the bones of our flight arrangements all booked up. Glasgow to Cairo via London, with almost five weeks in Egypt before flying to Amman for a further week. From Amman it was a flight to New Delhi and almost five weeks in India. After that Delhi to Bangkok and making our own way to Jogjakarta with a Flight to Singapore and a two night stopover. We really did need to see Raffles at least and drink at least one Singapore sling! :-) Then a flight to Beijing and three weeks with our own travel arrangements to get to Hong Kong for the flight to Tokyo. Three weeks in Japan, surely not enough, but sacrifices and compromises it had to be. We also booked flights to Australia, New Zealand, and Chile leaving rest of the journey up to Canada for the Flights back home left to us to arrange before we go or whilst underway.

We put Antipodes and the Americas to the back of our minds to concentrate on that first six month of our trip taking us eventually to Australia. Especially China Since in order to get a visa for Chine you have to have proof of your flights in and out and the booked accommodation for every night you are in China. Anyway, that's the stuff of another post.
