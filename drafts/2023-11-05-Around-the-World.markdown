Well, who would have thought?

We did, of course!

I must admit that I can't really remember when we first thought about it, but it's been around as a vague notion for quite some time. For years there was no real urgency, unlike the last time, I had commited myself to waiting until I finally retired. That, finally came, but only after a stolen year (and it wasn't I doing the stealing). 

I know they haven't been the only ones fiddling with pensioners money, but I consider the British Government to have stolen a year of my life and the cash to boot. We may well all be living longer, but there's two points to be made: I'm old enough to remember the promises of ever earlier retirement and ever shorter working weeks. This was to be the bonus of the new technological age. Aye right! We can't even afford the things we used to have never mind those we were promised. Why? We must be a poorer nation than we once were. If anyone holds that position, I'd like to see their workings for it, just as we always had to show them in our mathematics tests.

Anyway, I'm forgetting this is supposed to be a journal dedicated to our latest adventure.

The 31st of March came, but I had already left work two weeks earlier. Saved leave days and toiled overtime meant I did get that early retirement after all! Our minds didn't really turn to that vague trip around the world idea that we'd had for years. We'd spent the past ten years, or more, seeing the wonderful sights of Scotland and some summer trips to Europe. Life was really good and we had a head full of ideas of the other places we hadn't yet been. We'd been loving getting away in our wee 'two-man' tent of a van. Our first adventute was St Kilda. We'd booked it in January with the expectation that it may well be called off. However, I'll leave St Kilda for another post.

I'm not sure when it was that Vanessa told me about our friend Gina's wedding. Gina is from New Zealand and she had stayed with us last summer, when we met her new man too. There certainly wasn't any talk of an imminent wedding then. I'm guessing we were invited a wee while before I retired and we did fancy that it would be nice to go, but it wasn't until well after the St Kilda trip that the two came together: We had a wedding to go to and a suddenly 'unvague' idea that we really should get to see all those friends we had in different places around the world. We just had to got to Australia: to see Margie and Leoni, Kevin and Carmel; there was the weddding in New Zealand, of course; Virginia or Colorado (or wherever) to catch up with Carol and Pete; Los Angeles with Marlene and Dave, old friends of Vanessa and new friends for me to meet; Canada and Nicholas and Ann, hopefully Jess and Tim and Tiare too. 

Settled then!
